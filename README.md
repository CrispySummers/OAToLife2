# OA to Life
(I deleted the previous repository for this project)

This project aims to create an Endless Sky Mod that represents OA's planets, star systems, factions, and spaceships, in order to establish a bed upon which the community might be able to scaffold game campaigns and ideas. It is currently in prototype state. Have fun!

## Roadmap
- Capitals of all factions
- Other star systems that are required to understand a hyperpower
- "Interesting" planets - what counts as interesting is left for me and any contributors of this mod to decide
- Essential spaceships required to understand the OA universe - linelayers, transport ships, e.t.c
