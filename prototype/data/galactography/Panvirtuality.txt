	description
		Panvirtuality Core is a massive computronium structure encasing the blue hypergiant star Cygnus OB2-12. It serves as the central processing node for the Solipsist Panvirtuality's higher toposophic entities. The structure is incomprehensible to most sapient beings, with surfaces emitting patterns that defy conventional understanding.
